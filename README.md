A SIMPLE LTI LTI 1.1 UNIT TEST
------------------------------

This code is only an LTI 1.1 test and won't be updated to LTI 1.3.   LTI 1.3 is far more
complex then LTI 1.1 and my recommendation for building LTI 1.3 tools is to use the Tsugi
framework (www.tsugi.org) and build a Tsugi-specific tool and delegate all the complexity
of the modern suite of specs to the Tsugi framework.

You can use this test to exerciese your LTI 1.1 tools and LMS's at:

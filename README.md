A SIMPLE LTI UNIT TEST
----------------------

This was originally part of the Sakai Project and hosted several places.   But since the
test is in PHP and shares a lot of code from Tsugi and will likely evolve to make use of
the tsugi-php code libraries as it evolves, it made sense to pull it out of Sakai and
have it live in Tsugi and be hosted at www.tsugi.org - you can use this test at:

Comments, suggestions, issues, and pull requests welcome.
